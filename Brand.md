## Caricax Brand Assets & Guidelines (Draft)

**1. Introduction: Our Core**

Caricax exists to democratize sophisticated IT solutions, transforming them from exclusive privileges into common tools for Micro and Small Enterprises (MPEs). We believe Software is a Right, essential for local economic development and liberation from big-tech constraints. Our mission is driven by open-source principles, social impact, quality of life, and transdisciplinarity. We build functional, accessible, and personalized tools to empower local entrepreneurs.


**2. Logo System**

Our logo consists of two primary elements: the Symbol and the Wordmark. They can be used separately or together in approved lockups.

*   **Symbol:** An abstract, geometric form representing connection, networking, or a stylized 'CX'. Features a distinct gradient transitioning approximately from `#28aa6a` to `#25ac6c` (a subtle green-to-green shift).
    *   *(Visual representation available in the attached image)*
*   **Wordmark:** The name "CARICAX" presented in the Noto Serif typeface, featuring a gradient transitioning from `#fe6d03` to `#08c408`.
    *   *(Visual representation available in the attached image)*

*   **Primary Lockup (Suggestion):**
    *   **Vertical:** Symbol placed above the Wordmark.
    *   **Horizontal:** Symbol placed to the left of the Wordmark.
    *(Note: Formal lockups need to be designed, ensuring proper spacing and alignment).*

*   **Clear Space:** Maintain a minimum clear space around the logo (Symbol or Lockup) to ensure visibility and impact. This space should be equivalent to the height of the circle within the Symbol or the height of the 'X' in the Wordmark.
*   **Minimum Size:** Ensure the logo is always legible. The Symbol should not be used below [Specify Minimum Width, e.g., 20px] width, and the Wordmark should not be used below [Specify Minimum Width, e.g., 60px] width in digital applications. Print minimums may vary.
*   **Logo Misuse (Don'ts):**
    *   Do not squash, stretch, or distort the logo proportions.
    *   Do not change the logo's colors or gradients (except for approved single-color variations).
    *   Do not rotate the logo.
    *   Do not add extraneous effects like drop shadows, glows, or bevels.
    *   Do not place the logo on busy backgrounds that impair legibility. Use a solid color background or a container if necessary.
    *   Do not rearrange the elements of an official lockup.

**3. Color Palette**

Our palette reflects our connection to both technology and growth/community/open-source, with a touch of warmth and energy. Gradients are a key visual feature.

*   **Gradients:**
    *   **Gradient 1 (Symbol):** `#28aa6a` transitioning to `#25ac6c`.
    *   **Gradient 2 (Wordmark):** `#fe6d03` transitioning to `#08c408`.
